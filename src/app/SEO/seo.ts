  Summary of SEO Basics
  
  SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the practice of improving the ranking of websites in search engines.
  
  1. Meta Tags:
     - Meta tags provide information about the content of the page to search engines.
     - Important meta tags: title, description, keywords.
     - The title tag specifies the title of the page and appears in search results.
     - The description tag provides a brief summary of the page and appears in search results.
    Title Tag: Defines the title of the page and is usually the first line seen in search engine results.
     For example: <title>What is SEO?</title>.
        Meta Description: A short description seen under the title in search engine results.
         It should be unique and descriptive.
        Example: <meta name="description" content="Basic information about SEO">.
  
  2. Alt Attributes:
     - Alt attributes provide descriptions for images.
     - Used as alternative text if images cannot be loaded.
     - Alt attributes are important for visually impaired users.
     - Search engines use alt attributes to understand the content of images.
  
  3. Heading Structure:
     - Heading tags (h1, h2, h3, etc.) organize the content of the page hierarchically.
     - The h1 tag specifies the main heading of the page and should be used only once.
     - Other heading tags are used for subheadings and improve the readability of the page.
  
  Best Practices:
  - Conduct keyword research and include targeted keywords in the content.
  - Create a mobile-friendly and fast-loading website. Slow loading times negatively affect search rankings.
  - Use proper URL structure and optimize internal links.
